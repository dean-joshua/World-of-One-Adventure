# Overview

The application I have created is a mobile Choice based adventure game. It is based on another project I created that runs in the terminal. The game allows the user to submit a name and then play through a story by selecting buttons on the screen. It is titled World of One Mobile.

I created this application because of my love of both mobile apps and games. I had always intended to convert my application from a terminal based one to mobile. It was an opportunity for me to learn about the game making process on Android Studio and about how to work with activities.
